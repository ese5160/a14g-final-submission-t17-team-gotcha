# Device Description
Our Device solves the problem all traps have, live and otherwise. You must check the traps daily to see if they caught anything.
Our trap allows the user to know when the trap goes off, what animal they caught, and if its the wrong animal, a full resest of the trap.
The user learns this information by a message sent over the internet, and the message to reset the trap is sent over the internet as well.

# Inspiration
Veterinarian and Animal Shelters run Catch & Release Programs for Spaying & Neutering Animals. They trap stray cats and vaccinate and treat them before releasing them into the wild. We thought our design could help assist their limited workforce and resources by making the whole process more time efficient. 

# Device Functionality
The device is designed to  

Our sensors are as follows:

Our other critical components are:

The Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface - PCA9685
https://www.adafruit.com/product/815 
This board allowed us to take an I2C signal from our circuit board and translate it into three individual PWM motors.
